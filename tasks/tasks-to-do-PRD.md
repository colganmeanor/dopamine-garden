- `app/task-form.tsx` - Modal/screen for creating and editing tasks
- `components/TaskItem.tsx` - Reusable component for displaying individual tasks

- `components/EmptyState.tsx` - Component for showing empty state messages
- `components/DeleteConfirmation.tsx` - Modal for task deletion confirmation
- `hooks/useTasks.ts` - Custom hook for task state management and AsyncStorage operations
- `types/task.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for Task data model
- `utils/storage.ts` - Utility functions for AsyncStorage operations
- `utils/validation.ts` - Form validation utilities
- `styles/theme.ts` - Design system with colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens
- `components/TaskItem.test.tsx` - Unit tests for TaskItem component

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
